```

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Write clear and descriptive variable and function names
- Use meaningful interfaces for complex objects
- Handle errors gracefully with detailed error messages

### Debugging

For debugging the MCP server:

1. Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `true`
2. Use the MCP Inspector for interactive debugging:
   ```bash
   npm run inspector
   ```
3. Check the logs for detailed information about what's happening

### Adding New Tools

When adding new tools to the MCP server:

1. Define the tool in the `setupToolHandlers` method
2. Create a handler method for the tool
3. Add proper input validation and error handling
4. Update the README.md with documentation for the new tool
5. Update the Features section in the README.md
6. Update the autoApprove section in the configuration examples
7. Add tests for the new functionality

#### Recently Added Tools

The following tools have been recently added:

- **get_project_info**: Retrieves metadata about a Godot project
  - Analyzes project structure
  - Returns information about scenes, scripts, and assets
  - Helps LLMs understand the organization of Godot projects
  
- **capture_screenshot**: Takes a screenshot of a running Godot project
  - Requires an active Godot process
  - Saves the screenshot to the specified path
  - Useful for visual debugging and feedback

Example:

```typescript
// In setupToolHandlers
{
  name: 'your_new_tool',
  description: 'Description of what your tool does',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      param1: {
        type: 'string',
        description: 'Description of parameter 1',
      },
    },
    required: ['param1'],
  },
}

// Add handler method
private async handleYourNewTool(args: any) {
  // Validate input
  if (!args.param1) {
    return this.createErrorResponse(
      'Parameter 1 is required',
      ['Provide a valid value for parameter 1']
    );
  }

  try {
    // Implement tool functionality
    // ...

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Result of your tool',
        },
      ],
    };
  } catch (error: any) {
    return this.createErrorResponse(
      `Failed to execute tool: ${error?.message || 'Unknown error'}`,
      [
        'Possible solution 1',
        'Possible solution 2'
      ]
    );
  }
}
```

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

When making changes, ensure they work across different platforms:

- Use path utilities from Node.js (`path.join`, etc.) instead of hardcoded path separators
- Test on different operating systems if possible
- Consider different Godot installation locations
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Testing

- Add tests for new features when possible
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a Pull Request
- Test on different platforms if possible
- Test with different Godot versions

## Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date with new features
- Document all tools and their parameters
- Include examples for new functionality
- Update the troubleshooting section with common issues
